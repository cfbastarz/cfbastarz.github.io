Welcome!

My name is Carlos Frederico Bastarz. I am a technologist at the National Institute for Space Research ([Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br)) in Brazil. My work interests are numerical weather prediction, data assimilation, ensemble forecasting, model verification and post-processing. You can find some of my work developments in [GAD-DIMNT-CPTEC](https://github.com/GAD-DIMNT-CPTEC) and [GAM-DIMNT-CPTEC](https://github.com/GAM-DIMNT-CPTEC) organizations.

## Academics

You can find my full CV [here](cv.md).

I earned my Master and PhD degrees at the National Institute of Space Research studying Meteorology and Data Assimilation, in 2010 and 2017, respectively. My undergraduation is in Mathematics teaching.

## Work Experience

* Atmospheric data assimilation with methods like PSAS, 3DVar, EnKF and 3DEnVar;
* NMC method for the calculation of the background error covariance matrix for the Brazilian Atmospheric Model ([BAM](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wefo/31/5/waf-d-16-0062_1.xml)), for the sigma and hybrid vertical coordinates;
* Ensemble Forecasting using an EOF based perturbation method for the BAM model ([link](https://github.com/GAD-DIMNT-CPTEC/oensMB09));
* Objective model evaluation using the [SCANTEC](https://github.com/GAM-DIMNT-CPTEC/SCANTEC) and [SCANPLOT](https://github.com/GAM-DIMNT-CPTEC/SCANPLOT) softwares.

## Outside Work

I am most interested in personal computing in general and I also like to tinker with electronics devices. I am also a music passionate (classic rock and metal) and I also play guitar (acoustic and electric).
