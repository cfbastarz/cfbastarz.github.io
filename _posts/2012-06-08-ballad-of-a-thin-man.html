<p>Segue a letra:</p>
<p><strong>Ballad of a Thin Man</strong></p>
<p>You walk into the room<br />
With your pencil in your hand<br />
You see somebody naked<br />
And you say, “Who is that man?”<br />
You try so hard<br />
But you don’t understand<br />
Just what you’ll say<br />
When you get home</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
<p>You raise up your head<br />
And you ask, “Is this where it is?”<br />
And somebody points to you and says<br />
“It’s his”<br />
And you say, “What’s mine?”<br />
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”<br />
And you say, “Oh my God<br />
Am I here all alone?”</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
<p>You hand in your ticket<br />
And you go watch the geek<br />
Who immediately walks up to you<br />
When he hears you speak<br />
And says, “How does it feel<br />
To be such a freak?”<br />
And you say, “Impossible”<br />
As he hands you a bone</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
<p>You have many contacts<br />
Among the lumberjacks<br />
To get you facts<br />
When someone attacks your imagination<br />
But nobody has any respect<br />
Anyway they already expect you<br />
To just give a check<br />
To tax-deductible charity organizations</p>
<p>You’ve been with the professors<br />
And they’ve all liked your looks<br />
With great lawyers you have<br />
Discussed lepers and crooks<br />
You’ve been through all of<br />
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books<br />
You’re very well read<br />
It’s well known</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
<p>Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br />
And then he kneels<br />
He crosses himself<br />
And then he clicks his high heels<br />
And without further notice<br />
He asks you how it feels<br />
And he says, “Here is your throat back<br />
Thanks for the loan”</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
<p>Now you see this one-eyed midget<br />
Shouting the word “NOW”<br />
And you say, “For what reason?”<br />
And he says, “How?”<br />
And you say, “What does this mean?”<br />
And he screams back, “You’re a cow<br />
Give me some milk<br />
Or else go home”</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
<p>Well, you walk into the room<br />
Like a camel and then you frown<br />
You put your eyes in your pocket<br />
And your nose on the ground<br />
There ought to be a law<br />
Against you comin’ around<br />
You should be made<br />
To wear earphones</p>
<p>Because something is happening here<br />
But you don’t know what it is<br />
Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
