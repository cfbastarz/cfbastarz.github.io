<p>Hehehe, por essa, n√£o pude resistir... :P</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>	How many members of the U.S.S. Enterprise does it take to change a<br />
	light bulb?<br />
<strong>A:</strong>	Seven.  Scotty has to report to Captain Kirk that the light bulb in<br />
	the Engineering Section is getting dim, at which point Kirk will send<br />
	Bones to pronounce the bulb dead (although he'll immediately claim<br />
	that he's a doctor, not an electrician).  Scotty, after checking<br />
	around, realizes that they have no more new light bulbs, and complains<br />
	that he "canna" see in the dark.  Kirk will make an emergency stop at<br />
	the next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to procure a light bulb<br />
	from the natives, who, are friendly, but seem to be hiding something.<br />
	Kirk, Spock, Bones, Yeoman Rand and two red shirt security officers<br />
	beam down to the planet, where the two security officers are promply<br />
	killed by the natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.<br />
	As something begins to develop between the Captain and Yeoman Rand,<br />
	Scotty, back in orbit, is attacked by a Klingon destroyer and must<br />
	warp out of orbit.  Although badly outgunned, he cripples the Klingon<br />
	and races back to the planet in order to rescue Kirk et. al. who have<br />
	just saved the natives' from an awful fate and, as a reward, been<br />
	given all light bulbs they can carry.  The new bulb is then inserted<br />
	and the Enterprise continues on its five year mission.</p>
